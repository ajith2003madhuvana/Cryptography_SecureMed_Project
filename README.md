# Cryptography_SecureMed_Project
A privacy-preserving platform for secure management of healthcare data using cryptographic techniques and AI.

Overview
SecureMed is a comprehensive platform meticulously designed to address the critical need for secure data transmission and management within the healthcare domain. The platform ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and security of sensitive patient information, such as medical records and prescriptions, through the application of advanced cryptographic methodologies.

With SecureMed, patients and healthcare practitioners can securely authenticate, upload, download, and verify the integrity of medical records via a user-friendly web interface, ensuring seamless and secure healthcare data exchange.

Features
Advanced Encryption: Utilizes Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data encryption and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) for secure cryptographic key exchange.
Data Integrity: Employs Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) to ensure the integrity of transmitted data.
AI Integration: Leverages Artificial Intelligence technologies (TensorFlow, NumPy) to enhance computational efficiency and enable advanced data processing.
User-Friendly Interface: Developed with Streamlit, offering a clean, intuitive interface for easy interaction by patients and healthcare professionals.
Secure Healthcare Data Management: Guarantees secure upload, download, encryption, and decryption of medical records, as well as verification of data integrity.
